Challenge Questions

1. Password Authentication
    It is important because it means that even if an attacker gains access to the database, they don't see the actual password but only their hashed versions. 
    It has greater advantage over plain text as it makes it extremely difficult to reverse-engineer the original password hence enhancing security

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    It enhances security by requiring an extra verification step, beyond just a password, before completing a transaction.
    It prevents attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attempts

3. Balance verification
    It ensures that there are sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. 
    Skipping this step can lead to overdrafts, financial discrepancies, and potential losses for both user and institution

4. Daily Transaction Limit
    It caps the maximum amount that can be withdrawn in one day, reducing the potential loss from fraud or unauthorized access.
    This limit helps prevent excessive withdrawals and minimizes financial exposure for both the user and the institution

5. Improvement
    To add fraud detection, I would implement anomaly detection algorithms that monitor and compare current transaction against a user's historical behavior.
    I would also track data such as withdrawal frequency, transaction amount, time of day, geographic location, IP addresses and device info in order to flag abnormal
    patterns that might indicate fraudulent activity.
